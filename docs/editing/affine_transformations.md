Simple affine transformations (rotations and mirroring) can be done simply with the buttons in to top right of the edit bar:

1. **Horizontal Mirroring**: Mirrors the image around the vertical axis. This is practical if the photographed or scanned film was flipped.
2. **Rotation left/right**: Normal rotation in 90Â° steps of the image.
