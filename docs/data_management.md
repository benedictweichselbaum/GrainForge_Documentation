# Data Management
GrainForge knows different data objects and saves them discretely with the help of Apple's persistence frameworks within the Sandbox of the app. Objects are created when adding folders and images to the app or when creating film base colors or presets. Within the current state of the application no more persisted data models exist.
To allow data deletion for the user different mechanisms for deleting objects are available.

### Deleting Folders
see [Deleting Folders](/docs/Folders.html#deleting-folders)

### Deleting Photo Edits
When deleting a folder all corresponding photo edits are deleted to free up the space. Otherwise, photo edits are transparent to the user at all times.

### Deleting Film Base Colors and Presets

### Resetting the Application
