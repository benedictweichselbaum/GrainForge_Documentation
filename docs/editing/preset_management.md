# Preset Management
Central to the workflow within the application is the creation of presets. Presets are edit templates saving all edit parameters except the crop of an image.

The workflow for using presets works as the following:
1. Edit an example image for your preset.
2. **Save** the preset from the edit view.
3. **Apply** presets...
   1. for a single image (within the edit view).
   2. within the gallery (see [Gallery: Applying Presets](/docs/gallery.html#applying-presets)).
4. **Override** presets.
5. **Delete** presets (see [Data Management: Presets](/docs/data_management.html))
