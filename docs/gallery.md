# Gallery
The gallery is the first interface you encounter when selecting a folder.
By default, 36 images are loaded from the folder (see the upper footer bar).

The gallery has three elements:
- The gallery itself
- The mass-edit side bar
- The preset application

### Gallery images
In the gallery images are shown in their edited state.
#### Image selection
They can be selected by clicking once on them. When holding ⌘ multiple images can be selected and deselected.
With ⌘A all images can be selected.

To edit a single image and change to the edit view just double-click an image.
#### Image loading
At first, only 36 images are loaded. If your folder holds more images the bottom bar indicates this by showing you how many images can be loaded at max.
The button "Load More" on the right side loads 36 more images into the gallery.
