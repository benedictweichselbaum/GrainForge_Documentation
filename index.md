## The MacOS app for your analogue adventures

With GrainForge you can take your photographed or scanned film negatives or positives and digitally process them by developing your negatives, applying edits and curating your gallery.

This documentation shows you all the functionality of the application from core features to hidden tweaks for more advanced usage.

The application first started as a personal project because existing solutions where not exactly cheap nor offered me the functionality I personally wanted. My goal was to create a simple-to-use application for digitalizing film that when once configured offered a fast workflow in order to allow you to spend more time taking photos instead of processing them.

If you have bugs or feature requests you can tell me about it on my [GitHub issue board](https://github.com/benedictweichselbaum/GrainForge_Issues/issues) (GitHub account is required).
