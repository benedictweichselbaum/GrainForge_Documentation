# Overview and Application Principles
### General Structure
GrainForge is split into two parts vertically. On the left is the navigation bar where your added folders are shown and can be selected. The navigation bar can be put out of sight.

On the right the actual work takes place. It shows the main view where you curate and edit your image.

### Main Views
GrainForge knows two basic views in which the work takes place
- Gallery: The gallery is the first thing shown when selecting an added folder. It shows all images of the folder (not sub-folders).
- Edit: When selecting an image with a double-click the edit view is shown where you can process the images of the currently selected folder
